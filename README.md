# S5 modkit-template & Elytras's mods

Originally [Community template](ttps://github.com/DRG-Modding/FSD-Template) and [Community modkit](https://github.com/DRG-Modding/Community-Modkit)

Collection of my mods and some non base game references to be used from other mods needed for it to be compiled.
Contains a lot of my code in './Content/NewEnemies' and './Content/\_ElytrasMods'
Contains my automation script './builder.py' with some presets in './build_presets.yaml' (no guide, ask chatgpt to explain it or read the code yourself, though its not hard)
Contains for-editor python scripts in './Content/Python'
Contains some free FAB market stuff
Contains Bucks stuff from his modkit and i dont remember from what else
Contains AssemblyStorm's and Brain's stuff from './Content/\_AssemblyStorm' and './Content/\_Interop'

Have fun.
